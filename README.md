This is my project for my examination in programming

# problems that occurred during development process

1. jquery.min.js:2 Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'file:///Users/keanottesen/Documents/GitHub/HAIT-Exam-Project/navBarContainer.html' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https.

Solution: run on local server as chrome does not allow cross origin
